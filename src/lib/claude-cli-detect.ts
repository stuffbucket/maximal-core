/**
 * Detection + PATH-shim management for the `claude` CLI (Claude Code).
 *
 * "Detection" finds the `claude` that's actually active — the first real
 * `claude` on PATH (an in-process PATH walk, no subprocess). Only when
 * nothing is active on PATH does it fall back to probing known install
 * dirs and npm-global. An npm- or Homebrew-installed claude that is the
 * active one is on PATH too, so it's still found; copies that exist but
 * aren't active are intentionally ignored.
 *
 * "Shim" is a tiny `/bin/sh` wrapper we drop in a dedicated directory
 * (`~/.local/share/maximal/shims/`) as a file named `claude`. It sets
 * `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` (and optionally `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and then
 * `exec`s the *real* binary the user picked. It carries a
 * marker comment so we can (a) recognise our own shim and skip it in
 * the install list, and (b) refuse to ever clobber or delete a file
 * that is NOT our shim.
 *
 * Everything is parameterised by `homeDir` (and, for detection, the
 * PATH directory list / npm prefix / version reader) so the unit tests
 * can point at a tmp dir and fake binaries instead of the host machine.

//     verify ownership + mode before trusting it and refuse otherwise
//     (the StrictModes pattern from ssh).
//   - The file is written atomically: temp file (O_EXCL, no symlink
//     follow) → chmod 0700 → rename. The on-PATH `claude` only ever
//     appears as a complete, owner-written file, never a half-written
//     or attacker-pre-planted one. This closes the write-then-run TOCTOU
//     window.
