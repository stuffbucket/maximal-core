# Stream A — CI/CD + signed binaries

Working notes for the agent (me) owning Stream A. Symmetric to
`internal-distribution-stream-b.md`. Read the parent PRD
(`internal-distribution.md`) for full context.

## State at handoff

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** Internal repo migration | open — coordination, not code | Block on first internal release |
| **A2** CI on push/PR | ✅ already exists at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Verify after A1 — secrets/cache may need rename |
| **A3** Per-arch `bun --compile` | ✅ scaffolded — added `binaries` + `checksums` jobs to `release.yml` (this commit) | Codesign/notarize gated `if: false` until A4 |
| **A4** Signing + notarization | **deferred for v1** | Stubs left as `if: false`-gated `[DEFERRED A4]` steps. Flip after v1 if user feedback / compliance demands it |
| **A5** SBOM + license scan | ✅ wired | `scripts/sbom.ts` (pure Bun, no new deps) — emits CycloneDX 1.4 SBOM, fails build on disallowed license. Attached to release as `SBOM.cdx.json` |
| **A6** Smoke test on clean image | ✅ wired (Windows only) | `smoke` job runs on `windows-2022`; downloads the windows-x64 zip, unpacks, asserts `copilot-api debug --json` schema. No darwin smoke (public-repo: no macOS runners; manual mitigation via Homebrew install on a developer Mac pre-tag) |

## Vendored actions policy

Internal MS GitHub Actions environments reject non-MS/GitHub-sourced
actions. This repo follows a strict allowlist: any `uses:` reference
must resolve to either an `actions/*`-namespaced GitHub-published
action or a path-prefixed local composite under `.github/actions/`.

Currently vendored as local composites:

| Replaces | Local path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` | `./.github/actions/setup-bun` | Composite; runs the official bun.sh install script. Swap to an internal mirror if supply-chain policy tightens |
| `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` | `./.github/actions/upload-release-asset` | Composite; shells to `gh release upload` (preinstalled on runners) |

**Disabled** (would otherwise pull non-MS/GitHub actions):

- `release-docker.yml` — depends on `docker/*` + `sigstore/cosign-installer`; trigger removed (manual `workflow_dispatch` only). v1 ships binaries + DMG/MSI, not Docker images.

**Adding a new third-party action is not allowed.** Either:
1. Replace with shell + `gh` CLI inside an existing step.
2. Vendor as a new composite under `.github/actions/<name>/`.

## A3 — what's wired now

`.github/workflows/release.yml` was extended with two new jobs that
run after the existing `release` job (npm publish):

- **`binaries`** — single-runner (`ubuntu-latest`) matrix over the
  Bun cross-compile targets `(bun-darwin-arm64, bun-windows-x64)`.
  Public-repo policy: no macOS runners, and Intel macOS is not a
  supported target. Builds via
  `bun build --compile --minify --sourcemap --target=…`. Packages
  as `tar.gz` (mac) or `zip` (win). Generates per-file SHA-256.
  Attaches both to the GitHub release using
  `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`.
- **`checksums`** — runs after `binaries`. Fetches every `.sha256`
  from the release, concatenates into a sorted `SHA256SUMS`,
  re-uploads.

Codesign / notarize / signtool steps are present but `if: false` so
the workflow stays green pre-A4. Flip them on once cred plumbing
lands.

The **artifact-naming contract** with Stream B is documented in a
comment block at the top of the `binaries` job. Don't change it
without coordinating.

## A4 — what's still needed

Need three credential sets:

1. **Apple Developer notarization** — Apple ID, app-specific password,
   Team ID. Existing internal MS tooling has these; ask the parent
   issue for the secret names to use. Then flip the `if: false` on
   the macOS `Codesign` and `Notarize` steps.
2. **Microsoft Apple Developer ID Application cert** — for `codesign`.
   Stored in the GitHub Actions secret store (or a managed cert
   keychain on a self-hosted runner; check what the rest of the org's
   Mac tools use).
3. **Authenticode / Microsoft signing service** — Windows. Usually
   HSM-backed and requires a specific runner pool. The
   `Sign (Windows)` step is currently a `Write-Host` stub.

After A4 lands, repeat the smoke test (A6) on a clean managed device
and confirm Gatekeeper / SmartScreen don't prompt.

## A5 — SBOM + license scan (landed)

`scripts/sbom.ts` (~180 LOC pure Bun, zero new deps) walks the
production dependency graph from `package.json` + `node_modules/<dep>/
package.json`, emits a CycloneDX 1.4 SBOM, and asserts every license
is in an allowlist:

```
MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, BSD, ISC, Unlicense,
CC0-1.0, 0BSD, BlueOak-1.0.0, Python-2.0, WTFPL
```

Composite expressions (`(MIT OR Apache-2.0)`, `BSD-3-Clause AND MIT`)
are split on AND/OR and every leaf must be in the allowlist.

Loosen only with a documented justification in the commit message that
adds the new license. Switch to SPDX format if compliance prefers —
the script's `buildBom` is the single edit point.

Wired into `release.yml` between `Build` and `Generate GitHub Release
notes`. SBOM uploads to the release via the vendored
`upload-release-asset` action.

## A6 — smoke test (landed; Windows only)

`smoke` job in `release.yml` runs on `windows-2022` after `binaries`.
Downloads the windows-x64 zip, unpacks via `Expand-Archive`, runs
`copilot-api.exe debug --json`, parses with `ConvertFrom-Json` and
asserts each top-level key.

**Darwin smoke is not in CI** — public-repo policy excludes macOS
runners and we cannot exec a Mach-O on `ubuntu-latest`. Mitigations:

- The `binaries` job cross-compiles all targets from one Linux host
  with the same Bun version + flags, so the windows smoke is decent
  transitive evidence the darwin build also produced a valid binary.
- Pre-tag, run `copilot-api debug --json` once on a developer Mac
  before pushing.
- Post-tag, the first user via Homebrew exercises the binary and
  fails fast (B1's `service do` block surfaces a startup error
  immediately).

Asserted top-level keys: `version`, `git`, `runtime`, `config`,
`secrets`, `executor`. Mirrors the `DebugInfo` interface in
`src/debug.ts` — keep them in sync if the schema gains a key.

Catches static-link / missing-dep bugs the build alone misses, for
the windows target.

## Open questions for the team

1. **Internal repo URL.** Where does the repo land on the MS GitHub
   org? Need this to update `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSE` references and the
   Stream B Homebrew formula.
2. **Cert / cred set names** for Apple Developer and Authenticode in
   GitHub Actions secrets.
3. **SPDX vs CycloneDX** preference for internal compliance.
4. **Self-hosted runners?** If the Authenticode signing service
   requires a specific pool, configure `runs-on: [self-hosted, …]`
   in the matrix.

## Coordination with Stream B

Stream B starts on B5 (`setup` subcommand) immediately — no Stream A
dependency there. They wait for A3's first signed release before
working on B1 (Homebrew), B2 (.pkg), B3a/b (Windows installers).

When the first **unsigned** release publishes (now possible with this
commit), ping Agent B so they can validate the artifact-naming
contract end-to-end against B1's formula skeleton — even if signing
isn't done yet, the URL/SHA shape is final.
