# Context

A handful of CodeQL alerts are by-design for this project: it is an
auth-forwarding proxy, so reading a local token file and sending it to
an upstream over HTTP (`js/file-access-to-http`), and persisting a
freshly-received token back to a 0o600 file (`js/http-to-file-access`),
are exactly what the proxy exists to do. These are decisions with
rationale, not bugs to fix.

GitHub's Security tab records who dismissed each alert with what reason,
but the rationale is per-alert and not greppable. We want the "why" to
live in the repo, next to the code, surviving UI changes and account
churn.

# Decision

**Suppress by-design alerts with an inline CodeQL comment on the sink
line**, carrying the rationale inline:

```ts
const response = await fetch(url, {
  // codeql[js/file-access-to-http] -- by design: the proxy reads its own
  // 0o600 token from disk and forwards it as upstream Authorization. See ADR-0001.
  headers: authHeaders(state),
})
```

`// codeql[<rule-id>] -- <reason>` (legacy alias `// lgtm[...]`) is
CodeQL's native in-source suppression, honored by the JavaScript/
TypeScript analyzer. CodeQL emits it as a SARIF `suppressions` entry
with `@kind: IN_SOURCE`; GitHub code scanning then shows the alert as
resolved. The comment sits on the dataflow **sink** line, so it moves
with the code and the rationale is greppable at the exact point of
concern.

The current suppressed sites (grep `codeql\[` to enumerate):

| Rule | File | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/copilot/create-embeddings.ts` | Forward Copilot token upstream |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/copilot/get-models.ts` | Forward Copilot token upstream |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/github/get-user.ts` | Forward GitHub token upstream |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/github/get-copilot-usage.ts` | Forward GitHub token upstream |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `scripts/gemma-watch.ts` | Dev-only watcher → local Ollama |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/github/get-device-code.ts` | OAuth device-code flow |
| `js/file-access-to-http` | `src/services/github/poll-access-token.ts` | OAuth access-token flow |
| `js/http-to-file-access` | `src/lib/github-token-store.ts` | Persist OAuth token to 0o600 file |
| `js/http-to-file-access` | `scripts/sync-homebrew-formula.ts` | Release tooling renders a formula |

# Consequences

- **A suppression cannot drift.** The comment is attached to the sink
  line itself; when the code moves, the comment moves with it. There is
  no external `file:line` registry to fall out of sync.
- **No moving parts.** No reconcile script, no extra workflow, no
  `security-events: write` API writes, nothing to crash. The single
  `codeql.yml` analysis honors the comments directly.
- **Reversing a suppression is a one-line diff:** delete the comment.
  The next analysis re-opens the alert.
- **A new alert on an un-annotated sink is real signal** — it surfaces
  in the Security tab and gets either a code fix or a reviewed inline
  suppression, in the same PR that introduces it.
- **Rule-wide exclusions still belong in `query-filters`** in
  `.github/codeql/codeql-config.yml` — but only when we mean "never run
  this query," never as a substitute for a per-sink decision.

# Amendment (2026-07-03): superseded the reconcile-daemon approach

This ADR originally expressed the same decisions as `codeql_dismissals`
YAML frontmatter, enforced by a `scripts/reconcile-codeql.ts` daemon
(workflow `codeql-reconcile.yml`) that walked the live alert API and
dismissed/re-opened alerts to match the frontmatter.

That approach keyed each suppression on `file:line` in a registry stored
*outside* the source. Line numbers are the most volatile coordinate a
sink has, so ordinary edits above a sink silently broke the link: the
old dismissal stayed frozen on the old line while CodeQL opened a fresh
alert on the new line, and the reconcile pass — which only ever checked
*dismissed* alerts — reported "in sync" while live alerts sat open. A
separate bug in the re-open path (sending `dismissed_reason: null` with
`state: "open"`) also 422'd and crashed the workflow (fixed in #195).

Inline suppression removes the external key entirely and lets CodeQL's
own analysis do the drift-tracking it is built for, which serves this
ADR's original goal — greppable rationale that survives change — more
simply and more robustly. The frontmatter registry, the reconcile
script, and the `codeql-reconcile.yml` workflow are removed.
